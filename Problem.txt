Create an Employee class that stores an employeeâ€™s ID number and name. Then create an EmployeeMaps class that allows you to add Employee objects and look them up by their ID numbers. The EmployeeMap class should use a Map object to map ID numbers to Employee objects. Create an application to demonstrate the classes.
